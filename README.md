 <li>If     you      have     two      standard         six-­‐sided       dice,     each     with     uniform           probability         of        landing             on        each     counting          number           from     1          to               What               is         the       probability      of        rolling             doubles           (both    dice     landing            on        the       same    number)?</li>
